 --- INPUT--- 

Everything revolving around linear regression
linear agression not really ML - OPTIMIZATION

RANDOM FORREST is good at detectin not linear regression


ONLINE E-COMMERCE COMPANY - STARTUP

* We have two groups of customers: younger and older.
We need to come up with a solution how to serve both groups of customers.
What products are we selling? 
Based on the previous purchases we will predict in which group they are and what they will buy.

Technical things to overcome:

- consent (to use camera), accuracy, inconsistency (in customer preferences), quality of cust.camera,

What is a model?
simplified representation of reality

* conception
* test of assumptions
* training / validation
* validation

STATISTICAL SIGNIFICATE in Big Data is not that importan
testing smaller Data

overfitting problem

training is one itteration of the recipe

- choose the model
- train the model
- use data that you have
- specify the dependent variable

java strongly typed which works in Java Virtual Machines

Environments / Virtual Environments
for preventing libraries being old and unusable

IDE(RStudio, VSC) and Text Editors(notepad)

Browsers(Chrome, Brave)

Notebooks(Jupyter)


libraries and frameworks

DATA  --> TRAIN -> DEPLOY (PRODUCTION/TEST)
MODEL

Python or R
- Very different beasts
- Object oriented vs functional

- Libraries (Packages vs Modules)

- Package managers and repositories:
	
	- Python (PyPi)
	pip, anaconda
	- R(CRAN)
	install.packages()

TECHNICAL BUILDING BLOCKS

* Data sources
* Data storage
* Data processing

AML RISK (ABCD customers) A Lowest Risk D Highest for anti money laundering


AML Risk - dependent variable
other columns (3-9) - independent variables

1. Features == Independent variables describe your data
2. Parameters 
3. Hyper-Parameters describe your model defined

In LR no. Parameters and no. Independent variables is connected
in RandomTrees and NN is not.
